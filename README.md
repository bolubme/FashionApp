# Thrift Fashion

## 2.0 Introduction

Many people discard clothing items when they are no longer in use or are worn out. Clothes purchased from malls, online stores, or local shops often end up in the trash after being worn only a few times. Even expensive clothing is frequently discarded after minimal use. This creates a significant environmental burden, as discarded clothing contributes to waste accumulation and disposal challenges.  

To address this, our team developed **Thrift Fashion**, a mobile application designed to help individuals shop online for pre-used, fashionable clothing. Users can also provide feedback on the app using a feedback form, allowing continuous improvement of the platform.
